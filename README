This repository provies a python toolbox for simulating hydronic home heating loops,
based on the mathematical model presented in Zaheer-Uddin & Monastriakos (1998).

Intended use: rapidly testing control strategies for hydronic boilers.
This repo includes an implementation of the hydronic loop described in the cited paper 
(i.e. one heating zone, one radiator).
To simulate a different building or loop configuration:
- Modify hydronic.py to match the hydronic loop configuration for the building under
investigation.
- Validate the building heat loss coefficients using actual building data (if desired).
- Adjust BoilerCtrlPID.py to implement whatever control strategy you want to evaluate, and run it.

See hydronic.py and BoilerCtrlPID.py, and comments therein, for more information.
